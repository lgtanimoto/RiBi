# RiBi
RiskIt or BISCIT

RiskIt or BISCit is a "full-stack" game similar to Deal or No Deal for author to experiment with various "full-stack" technologies. In its current iteration, it is very much a v0.1 application with a terrible UI and mamy functions to be developed/

Similar to "Deal or No Deal" the player must choose 1 of 26 cases containing an amount of BISC (Binary Information Set Cash) from $.01 to $1,000,000. After choosing the initial case, the player must choose to display the amount in other cases to see what is not in the initial case. After displaying some of these other cases, the player is given the choice to display more cases or take an amount of BISC offered by the banker named "Crypto".

Beyond the basics of "Deal or No Deal", the game provides tracking of the players performance across multiple games and how well the player did relative to other players. Ideally, this RiskIt or BiscIt (aka RiBi) can be used as a "fitness app" to help players better think statistically/probabilistically, think about lomg-term vs short-term optimization stategies, and better understand the difference between skill and luck.

The current version is extremely limited - a v0.1 release - for author to learn full-stack technologies.   Some things to work on for the next release (v0.2 date TBD) are as follows:

- Support for multiple users using RiBi at the same time
- Much. much better UI including use of React and Jquery.  (JQuery not really necessary in this iteration)
- Additional reports on high score on first game, within first 5 games, highest average after first 5 games, highest average after first 25 games, highest overall average 
- Logging for more initial profile questions, reflection on each game, logging for each individual stage before riskit/biscit is asked
- Support for Passport/Oauth
- Learn how to use GitHub with Herokuapp more effectively
